              cmd.khulnasoft.com is an open-source, searchable collection of popular
              terminal commands curated from across the internet. You can look
              up commands by category (git, android, docker) and each command
              will tell you exactly what parameters need to be inserted.

              Every engineer has had a moment where they forget a terminal
              command because it is rarely used or has complex parameters that
              are hard to understand. When that happens, they’re forced to do a
              tedious search through their terminal command history or open up
              an Internet browser just to look through StackOverflow or outdated
              team wikis.

              cmd.khulnasoft.com is meant to fix this problem. By compiling a list of
              hard-to-remember terminal commands, we hope to become one of the
              go-to places on the Internet that developers can consult when they
              hit a wall. No more context-switching or wasting precious
              engineering time.

              Our team started by collecting commands from common StackOverflow
              posts, because we believed that would translate to commands that
              users often have trouble remembering. We’ve also had over 20
              contributions from users within our community contribute to this
              list of commands, and you can see their Github usernames
              attributed in each corresponding command card.

              user, this repository powers the workflow menu within Warp so you
              can search commands within the terminal too. You can essentially
              think of Workflows as cmd.khulnasoft.com inside the Warp terminal! It
              just makes it easier for developers to access the list of commands
              directly, so they don’t need to context switch out of their
              terminal session into an Internet browser.
